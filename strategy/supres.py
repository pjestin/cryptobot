    """Support and Resistance Testing
    Identifies support and resistance levels of provided price action data.
    Args:
        n(int): Number of frames to evaluate
        low(pandas.Series): A pandas Series of lows from price action data.
        high(pandas.Series): A pandas Series of highs from price action data.
        min_touches(int): Minimum # of touches for established S&R.
        stat_likeness_percent(int/float): Acceptable margin of error for level.
        bounce_percent(int/float): Percent of price action for established bounce.
    
    ** Note **
        If you want to calculate support and resistance without regard for
        candle shadows, pass close values for both low and high.
    Returns:
        sup(float): Established level of support or None (if no level)
